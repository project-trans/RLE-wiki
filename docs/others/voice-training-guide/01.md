# L's Voice Training Guide (Level 1) for MTF transgender vocal feminization

<!--
1. Inspiration
-->
## 1.1 灵感

<!--
Start by watching this video for a really quick overview of the voice feminization process (and optionally, this video to learn more about the acoustic theory involved). Then watch this video for a breakdown of the vocal anatomy involved.

Your homework is to find a recording of a female speaking voice that you'd like to be able to imitate, that can serve as an inspiration and a point of reference. It doesn't have to be the one perfect, ultimate voice - just find one or two examples that seem pleasant and relatable. Think of female actresses or characters with nice voices, or YouTubers or podcast hosts you enjoy (search for "female youtubers" or "female podcast hosts" if you need some ideas). Mine is this podcast interview with Keon Saghari. Go ahead and use that if you can't decide on one right now!

Then start listening to it, at least a little bit every day. This will help you internalize the sounds and speech patterns of the voice that you like. And be on the lookout for new voices - if you find one you like better, start listening to that one instead!

首先，观看[这段视频](https://youtu.be/dZKzuVfUv3E)，以了解声音女性化训练的整体流程（也可以看看[这个](https://youtu.be/ynFqjE2AEGk)）。然后，观看[这段视频](https://youtu.be/xVAVi11kzbM?t=133)，了解发声相关的解剖学概念。

作业：找到一段女性讲话录音，作为参考和灵感来源。
它不必绝对理想或完美，只需听起来悦耳、与你相契合即可。
可以考虑有好听声音的女性演员或角色，或者是你喜欢的女性 YouTuber、博客主持人（如果没有想法，可以搜索“女性 YouTuber”或“女性播客主持”）
我选的是[Keon Saghari 在一档播客节目中的采访](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pIUvhv59np_tDRK7w0s75IQ3ByIoG6bs)，如果你暂时选不出来，可以先用这个！

然后，每天至少听一小段录音。这会帮助你内化喜欢的声音和语音模式。同时，也可以不断寻找新声音 —— 如果找到更喜欢的，就切换到新的参考录音！

2. Vocal Tract Length
-->
## 1.2 声道长度

<!--
Next you want to start strengthening and learning to control the muscles that raise your larynx (or voice box). This is how you shorten the length of your vocal tract, from your larynx to your lips, to match the proportions of a typical female vocal tract. Building these muscles will take a while, so we'll start with this first.

Do not do the swallow-and-hold exercise from this video, as the hold can cause unnecessary strain, but do try swallowing a few times. You want to touch your larynx (Adam's apple) lightly with your finger, and then yawn and feel it move down, and then swallow and feel it move up.

Once you have felt this a few times, watch this video and try the "big dog, small dog" exercise. If you're having trouble with the small dog, it can help to start yawning, to bring the larynx down, and then start to swallow to bring the larynx up, and then stick your tongue out like a dog panting and say "ahh" in a whisper to make sure you're not closing off your throat. Then watch this video and try the whisper siren exercise. You want to smoothly slide from a big dog "uhh" to a small dog "ehh" as your larynx slides upward. Again, place a finger or two lightly on your throat to feel your larynx move up and down.

Your homework is to practice the whisper siren for few minutes whenever you remember, throughout the day - say, whenever you go to the bathroom. It's almost silent, so you can do it anywhere and practice holding your muscles in place at the top (the high end of the siren, or the small dog) to build strength. Eventually, you want to learn to lift your larynx easily, without straining the muscles in your jaw and neck. As you get more comfortable with it, try to relax your neck a little bit more each time, until you can do it without tension. -->

接下来，我们要锻炼并学会控制抬高喉结的肌肉。这样就可以缩短声道从喉结到嘴唇区间的长度，使其长度更接近女性的典型声道。训练这些肌肉需要时间，我们会从如下的方法开始：

请不要[做这个视频](https://youtu.be/aWWevU4A5mU)中的吞咽后保持喉结上升的练习，因为这可能会导致肌肉的过度拉伸，造成疼痛和不适，但可以尝试简单地吞咽几次。同时，用手轻触喉结，可以感受到：打哈欠会使得喉结向下移动，吞咽会使得喉结向上移动。

在这之后，尝试[这段视频](https://youtu.be/mx4dPWKVt9o)里的“大狗、小狗”练习。
如果感觉“小狗”声音很难发出来，可以先打哈欠，让喉结下移，然后吞咽，让喉头上移，再伸出舌头模仿小狗喘气，然后轻声发出“哈啊”，期间确保喉咙敞开。然后观看[这段视频](https://youtu.be/F6Noi2qERus)，尝试“静悄悄的汽笛”练习。在从“大狗”声音慢慢过渡到“小狗”声音的同时，感受喉结的的上升。同样，可以用手轻触喉结，以确认喉结的移动。

::: info 作业
每天利用空闲时间练习几分钟的“静悄悄的汽笛”，比如在洗澡的时候。这个练习几乎是无声的，所以可以在任何地方进行，并在最高音（类似“小狗”的声音）时保持喉部肌肉稳定，以增强肌肉力量。这个练习的目的是学会轻松抬起喉结，同时下颚和颈部的肌肉不用过度发力。随着练习的深入，逐渐尝试放松颈部，直到可以毫不费力地完成这个练习。

3. Pitch
-->

## 1.3 音高

<!--
Keep doing the previous exercises every day, but when you're ready for something more, you can start working on your pitch, or how high or low your voice is. Pitch is just one of many elements, and not even the most important, but it's probably the most well-known difference between the average male and female voice.

In addition to pitch, there are several registers that your voice will lock into at different points along your range, each with a different sound quality. Watch this video to hear the differences between a chest voice and a falsetto (and a mix voice, which is technically the same register as your chest voice, your modal register). Follow along with the warmups in this video, and then try switching between the registers a few times, both singing and speaking.

Then download the Android app Vocal Pitch Monitor (or Vocal Pitch Monitor on iOS) and in the settings, change the Scale to D Major and check the box to Display frequency in Hz. With the app running, talk in your starting voice and see where your pitch falls, naturally. A typical male speaking voice will stay between D2 and D3 (which are marked by horizontal lines, since we set the Scale to D Major). Now try talking higher and higher in pitch, until your voice is in the female range, around D3 (150 Hz) and above. Don't go higher than D4 (300 Hz), though, or you'll sound like a cartoon character!

每天继续做之前的练习，并熟练掌握之后，可以开始练习音高。音高只是音色的众多要素之一，甚至不是最重要的，但它可能是男声和女声之间最为人熟知的差异。

除了音高，声音在不同音域上会进入不同的音区，每个音区都有不同的音质。[观看这个视频](https://youtu.be/CYEsGuldIQY)，听听胸声、假声和混合音之间的区别（混合音在技术上与胸声是同一个音区，即你的语调音区），然后跟随[这个视频](https://youtu.be/9-1Padxsmio?t=281)中的热身练习，尝试在唱歌和说话时切换音区。

接着下载安卓应用程序 [Vocal Pitch Monitor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tadaoyamaoka.vocalpitchmonitor&hl=en_US)（[或者 iOS 上的这个](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocal-pitch-monitor/id842218231)）并在设置中将音阶改为 D 大调，并勾选显示频率为 Hz。运行该应用后，用你最初的声音说话，看看你的音高自然落在哪里。典型的男性说话音高一般会在 D2 和 D3 之间（由于我们将音阶设置为 D 大调，所以这些音符会有水平线标记）。现在尝试逐渐提高音高，直到你的声音进入女性音域，大约是 D3（150 Hz）及以上。但不要超过 D4（300 Hz），否则你会听起来像二次元！

<!--
You might find that you start in your modal register when you're in the male range, but flip over into falsetto at some point in order to get into the female range. Or you might find that you have to strain and shout to get that high. If that happens, just go back down to the pitch where you can still speak comfortably in your modal register and don't worry about going higher for now.

Your homework is to set aside some time every day (say, half an hour) to warm up with the video above and then practice speaking in the female range (between D3 and D4, or 150-300 Hz) or as close as you can get without straining or going into a falsetto. You can just say random things that pop into your head, recite lines from memory, or read a book or reddit comments out loud, while keeping an eye on your pitch in Vocal Pitch Monitor.

It might sound terrible, but that's okay - the important thing is to get used to speaking in that range. Drink water throughout and take a break if you feel your voice getting strained or hoarse.
 -->
你可能会发现，当处于男性音域时，可以在语调音区中说话，但为了进入女性音域，可能需要转到假声；或者你可能会发现你需要用力喊叫才能达到足够的音高。如果发生这种情况，没关系，只需要回到你能够舒适地使用语调音区说话的音高，不用担心暂时无法达到更高的音高。

::: info 作业
每天抽出一些时间（比如半小时）按照热身视频做练习，然后练习在女性音域（D3 到 D4 之间，或者 150-300 Hz）说话，或者尽可能接近该音域，但不要用力喊叫或进入假声。可以随便说点什么，背诵一些台词，大声朗读书籍或者帖子，同时注意在 Vocal Pitch Monitor 中的音高。

一开始可能会很难听，但没关系，重要的是习惯在这个音域内说话。记得多喝水，如果觉得嗓子紧绷、声音沙哑，就休息一下。
